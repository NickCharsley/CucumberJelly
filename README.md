# CucumberJelly

This is an atempt to provide a module to provide a way to Test a Netbeans Platform with Cucumber.

It will also provide some 'Standard Jelly Steps' to help ensure that we get easy testing.

This is an extension of https://github.com/NickCharsley/MavenNetBeansPlatformCucumberBBD which uses this.

This is my first experiment with both Maven and Netbeans Platform so I may have done something terible with either
coding style or dependencies or choice of package etc.

If you think its criminal please either help by forking and correcting or leave a *nice* issue and I'll see what can be done.
